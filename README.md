# rock_paper_scissors
A task to create a Rock Paper Scissors game during I4gxZuri Training

# Instructions
- When the program is run, ask the user to pick an option between "R", "P" or "S"
- If user input is invalid (not amongst our options), print an error, and ask for their input again (should be a loop)
- Use the `choice` function from the inbuilt Python `random` module to make a choice for CPU player(computer).
- Print both player's moves in the format: `Player (Rock) : CPU (Paper)`
- Check both player's moves: 
- If there is a winner, print the winner, and the program ends. 
- If it's a tie (the computer and player pick the same move), restart the game from step 3
